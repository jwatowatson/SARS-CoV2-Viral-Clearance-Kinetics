# SARS-CoV2-Viral-Clearance-Kinetics

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 Viral Clearance Kinetics to Improve the Design of Antiviral Pharmacometric Studies.

This repository accompanies our [publication in AAC]{https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00192-22}.

This is an analysis of openly available serial viral load data from the NBA bubble. We fit a series of simple viral kinetics models; show that clearance is bi-exponential; and then show that directly estimating rate of clearance under a log-linear model is a superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance for intervention studies of antiviral agents.
